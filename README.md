# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
<img src=./assets/images/work-day-schedule.png>
I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The code uses the Moment.js (https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

Simply open the web page: https://crocket77.github.io/ethans-super-disco/
Enter in all the tasks for the day that you have. When you come back tomorrow the tasks will still be there so you can see if you accomplished your tasks or not.
